 - Right now any txBlock whose moveCall targets are whitelisted in the Enoki Portal can be sponsored
 - In mainnet products, we will probably want to add constraints, such as:
  - require a JWT token if the user is signed in with Enoki
  - require a signed message if the user uses wallet-kit
  - require that the number of commands in the txBlock is exactly one, we can check this via `TransactionBlock.from(txBytes)`
  - require that the allowedAddresses only contain the sender's address (in case of an airdrop)
